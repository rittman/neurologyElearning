        <p>Pharmacological treatments with their rationale and main side-effects are outlined in the table below. These are symptomatic treatments, and often patients will have to stop these medications because of side-effects or absence of benefit.</p>
        <p>Postural hypotension in particular may be exacerbated by dopaminergic therapy, in some cases severe enough to render the patient bed-bound and unable to walk. In this situation reducing the levodopa dose may be the most effective treatment for debilitating postural hypotension.</p>
