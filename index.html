  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Just a note that this eLearning module will run best in a google chrome browser (compatible with all features of html5).</p>
  <p>Parkinson's disease is a systemic disorder. Lewy bodies have been found in the gut of people with Parkinson's disease, with some arguing that is where the pathology of Parkinson's disease begins.</p>
  <p>As neurologists we tend to focus on the motor features of Parkinson's disease because they are easy to ask about and we have a wide range of treatment options. However, non-motor features are often difficult to elicit and difficult to treat. Furthermore, they are much more closely related to the quality of life of people with Parkinson's disease.</p>
  <p>This module aims to address the range of non-motor features of Parkinson's disease. The goal is to familiarise you with the range of non-motor features, and to begin to understand the pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches that are required to properly address these difficult symptoms.</p>
