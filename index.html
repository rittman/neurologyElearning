  <p>Just a note that this eLearning module will run best in a google chrome browser (compatible with all features
  of html5).</p>
  <p>Parkinson's disease is a systemic disorder. Lewy bodies have been found in the gut of people with Parkinson's
  disease, with some arguing that is where the pathology of Parkinson's disease begins.</p>
  <p>As neurologists we tend to focus on the motor features of Parkinson's disease because they are easy to ask
  about and we have a wide range of treatment options. However, non-motor features are often difficult to elicit
  and difficult to treat. Furthermore, they are much more closely related to the

  quality of life of people with
  Parkinson's disease.</a></p>
  <p>This module aims to address the range of non-motor features of Parkinson's disease. The goal is to familiarise
