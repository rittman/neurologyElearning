						<h3>Depression</h3>
						<p>The diagnosis of depression can be challenging in Parkinson's disease because of overlapping symptoms, particularly distinguishing bradykinesia and psychomotor slowing. However, along with other neurodegenerative diseases, the prevalence of depression is higher than expected among people with Parkinson's disease.</p>
						
						<p>Furthermore, depression can often be readily managed and treated. The mainstay of pharmacological management are SSRI medications such as citalopram. Venlafaxine can be helpful if there is an element of anxiety and Mirtazepine can be helpful in promoting sleep.</p>
						
						<h3>Fatigue</h3>
						
						<p>In common with many neurological disorders, fatigue often plays a big role in Parkinson's disease. Treatments are limited in their efficacy, but Amantadine or Modafanil can be tried for severe fatigue.</p>
						
						<h3>Dry eyes</h3>
						
						<p>Xerostomia (dry eyes) are common in Parkinson's disease, lubricating eye drops can be helpful. A common mistake is to see watery eyes and assume the eyes are well lubricated. A reduced blink rate reduces the rate of re-lubrication of the eye and means the normal clearing of tears during a blink does not happen.</p>
						
						<h3>Excessive salivation</h3>
						
						<p>A reduced swallowing rate leads to hypersalivation as saliva is not cleared. This can be treated pharmacologically with hyoscine (a muscarinic antagonist) patches behind the ear, although this can increase cognitive symptoms. An alternative option is to use sublingual atropine (1%) eye drops.</p>
						
						<h3>Pain and sensory symptoms</h3>
						<p>The severity of pain may change with motor fluctuations. Simple analgesia such as paracetamol and NSAIDs are usually sufficient.</p>
						
						
						<h3>Weight loss</h3>
						<p>Many neurodegenerative disorders are associated with excessive metabolism, although the cause is unclear. In Parkinson's disease the weight loss is above that expected, even if a tremor is present.</p>
						
						<h3>Anosmia</h3>
						
						<p>An impaired sense of smell is perhaps the earliest marker of Parkinson's disease and is present in up to 90% of people with Parkinson's disease, commonly occurring many years prior to symptoms onset.</p>
