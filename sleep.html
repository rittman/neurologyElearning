								<h2>Sleep disorders</h2>
								<p>A surprisingly large number of sleep disorders associated with Parkinson's disease. Recognising and addressing them can have a large impact on quality of life.</p>
							</div>

						<h3>REM-sleep Behavioural Disorder</h3>
						<p>REM-sleep Behavioural Disorder (RBD) symptoms are associated with synuclein pathology (Parkinson's disease or Multiple System Atrophy) and usually precede motor symptoms by years or decades. The symptoms are usually reported by the bed partner who describes patients acting out their dreams such as shouting, kicking or punching. The usual "off switch" of motor function in the brainstem nuclei of thalamocortical pathways during REM sleep fails to impair movements generated during dreams. Linked to this, many people with Parkinson's disease have vivid dreams.</p>
						
						<p>The presence of RBD in otherwise asymptomatic people is a strong predictor of later Parkinson's disease. Recent studies suggest that up to <a href="http://www.sleep-journal.com/article/S1389-9457%2812%2900381-4/fulltext?mobileUi=0">80% of people with RBD may develop Parkinson's disease after 16 years.</a></p>
						
						<p>Treatment with small doses of Clonazepam (250-500 microgrammes) is usually effective if the symptoms are troublesome.</p>
						
						<h3>Other sleep abnormalities</h3>
						<p>Click on each sleep abnormality below for more information.</p>
						<details>
							<summary>Abnormal sleep architecture</summary>
							
							<p>Parkinson's disease increases the latency to sleep onset and reduces the time spent in stage 3 and 4 (deep) sleep. This combination leads to the symptoms of both primary and secondary insomnia.</p>
							<p>Although there may be multiple factors at play, the degeneration of brainstem nuclei in the thalamocortical pathways and disruption of circardian rhythm are major factors.</p>
						</details>
						
						<details>
							<summary>Sleep attacks</summary>
							<p>These are particular associated with dopamine agonist medications. Sleep attacks are characterised by sudden attacks of sleepiness, in its most severe form can be similar to narcolepsy.</p>
						</details>
						
						<details>
							<summary>Restless legs</summary>
							<p>An overwhelming sensation to move the legs, it may be accompanied by tingling, burning, throbbing or itching. It is treatable with dopamine agonists.</p>						
						</details>
						
						<details>
							<summary>Central apnoea</summary>
							<p>Sleep apnoea is symptomatically reported by bed partners as episodic cessation of breathing, often accompanied by heavy snoring. Central sleep apnoea occurs in Parkinson's disease, but early central sleep apnoea is a feature of Multiple System Atrophy.</p>						
						</details>
						
						<p>All these abnormalities of sleep can be identified using polysomnography. Below is an example from <a href="http://www.annalsofian.org/article.asp?issn=0972-2327;year=2014;volume=17;issue=3;spage=287;epage=291;aulast=Joy" target="PSGarticle">a patient with untreated Parkinson's disease.</a></p>

							<figcaption>This polysomnography recording demonstrates obstructive sleep apnoea, highlighted by the green box demonstrating no air flow for 17.7 seconds. In addition, there are periodic limb movements picked up as muscle movements in the bottom line of the recording. The top four lines of this polysomnogram record EEG activity from scalp electrodes. Other monitors on parts of the body detect motion (eg chest and abdominal motion), an ECG records the heart rhythm, and a sats probe records oxygen levels.</figcaption>
