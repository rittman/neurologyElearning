<h2>Cognitive symptoms</h2>
<p>
  Although Parkinson's disease is not a dementia, 80% of patients will have detectable cognitive impairment after 10 years. Cognitive changes in Parkinson's disease takes two forms, one affecting the frontal lobes and the other affecting posterior brain regions. There are two separate entities of Parkinson's disease dementia and Lewy Body Dementia which are beyond the scope of this eLearning package.

  Changes in the frontal lobes in Parkinson's disease are subtle yet common. They are not as prominent as other disorders (eg Frontotemporal dementia). The most prominent changes are in executive function, which involves planning and rule learning.

<p>
  One simple test of executive funtion is the Trails Test, which is part of the <a href="http://www.mocatest.org/">Montreal Cognitive Assessment</a>.

  Changes in posterior brain regions may herald the onset of Parkinson's disease dementia and usually occur late in the disease process. Not everybody with Parkinson's disease will progress to dementia, but there are tests that can help predict who will do so.

  Difficulty copying these interlocking pentagons can predict later cognitive decline. This test assesses constructional apraxia, a parietal lobe function.

  It is important to note that dopaminergic medication may make some aspects of cognition worse. Hallucinations and paranoia may be exacerbated by the effect of dopamine D2 receptors in mesolimbic pathways. Frontal dysexecutive cognition may also be made worse by 'overloading' dopaminergic systems in the prefrontal cortex.
